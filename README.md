## hi hello

* i like writing stuff.
* yes.

## but all jokes aside

so, first thing's first, hello there. i'm a person that exists, and i like writing stuff. some of the stuff i write sometimes may or may not include:

```html
<h1>first language</h1>
<p>html</p>
```

```css
:root {
    --second-language: css;
}
```

```js
// function

function thirdLanguage() {
    console.log('plain javascript');
    console.log('(only a very small amount, though!)');
}

// fire function

thirdLanguage();
```

```py
amount = "just a small bit"
language = "python

print(f"{amount} of {language}")
```

putting that aside, i mainly hold this account as a way to educate myself about the sort of flow that this system provides, so don't expect much as far as activity goes.

however, this doesn't mean i'm that far out of reach. feel free to extend a hand and ask me about stuff. i probably won't know what you're talking about, but that's okay.
