# hi hello

* i like writing stuff.
* yes.

## but all jokes aside

* hi, i'm an individual on the interwebs that likes writing **html** and **css**. with a very, *very* minimal amount of experience with plain **javascript**.
* i mainly hold this account in case i want to do anything, so don't expect much as far as activity goes.
* it's more of a way to educate myself in how github works and the flow of a lot of things
